## Stub-Driven Development (SDD) Flow

Stub-Driven Development (SDD) is a software development strategy where you define and implement placeholder "stubs" or "mocks" for dependencies before (or in parallel with) developing the core components that rely on them. This approach is particularly useful in complex projects with multiple interconnected modules or services.

### Core Idea

The main idea is to build and test components in isolation by simulating the behavior of their dependencies. Once the component is working correctly with the stubs, these stubs are gradually replaced by the actual implementations.

### Benefits of Stub-Driven Development

*   **Parallel Development:** Different teams or developers can work on different components concurrently. A frontend team can develop against a stubbed backend API while the backend team is still building it.
*   **Early Feedback & Iteration:** Allows for earlier testing and UI/UX feedback on features, as parts of the application can be demonstrated even if underlying services aren't fully ready.
*   **Clear Interface Definition:** Forces clear definition of contracts (API specifications, function signatures, data formats) between components early in the development cycle.
*   **Reduced Integration Risk:** Incremental integration of real components helps identify and resolve issues sooner, rather than facing a "big bang" integration problem at the end.
*   **Simplified Testing:** Components can be unit-tested in isolation more easily, as dependencies are predictable and controlled via stubs.
*   **Focus on Core Logic:** Developers can concentrate on the business logic of their specific component without being blocked by the availability or instability of external dependencies.

### Typical Steps in an SDD Flow

1.  **Identify Dependencies:** Determine the external modules, services, or data sources your component will interact with.
2.  **Define Interfaces/Contracts:** Specify how your component will interact with these dependencies. This includes:
    *   API endpoints and request/response formats for services.
    *   Function/method signatures and data structures for libraries or modules.
    *   Expected data schemas for databases or data sources.
3.  **Implement Stubs/Mocks:** Create lightweight, placeholder implementations for each dependency. These stubs should:
    *   Adhere to the defined interface/contract.
    *   Return predictable, sample data or mimic basic behavior (e.g., success/error responses).
    *   For example, a stub for a user service might always return a predefined user object, or a mock for a payment gateway might simulate successful and failed payment scenarios.
4.  **Develop Component Against Stubs:** Build your primary component, writing code that calls the stubs as if they were the real dependencies.
5.  **Unit Test with Stubs:** Write unit tests for your component, leveraging the stubs to control dependency behavior and verify your component's logic under various conditions.
6.  **Iterate and Refine:** Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to your component and its interactions with the (stubbed) dependencies.
7.  **Integrate Real Implementations:** As the actual dependencies become available (or are developed by other teams), replace the stubs with the real implementations one by one.
8.  **Integration Testing:** Conduct thorough integration tests to ensure your component works correctly with the actual dependencies.

### Conceptual Example: Developing a New "Product Recommendation" Feature

Imagine you're building a new "Product Recommendation" feature for an e-commerce website. This feature needs to:
*   Fetch the user's browsing history from a `UserActivityService`.
*   Get product details from a `ProductCatalogService`.
*   Display recommendations in the UI.

**SDD Approach:**

1.  **Dependencies Identified:** `UserActivityService`, `ProductCatalogService`.
2.  **Interfaces Defined:**
    *   `UserActivityService`: `GET /users/{userId}/history` (returns list of product IDs).
    *   `ProductCatalogService`: `GET /products/{productId}` (returns product details).
3.  **Stubs Implemented:**
    *   `StubUserActivityService`: When called, returns a fixed list like `["prod123", "prod456"]`.
    *   `StubProductCatalogService`: When called with `prod123`, returns a sample product JSON; for `prod456`, another sample.
4.  **Develop Recommendation Logic:** The recommendation engine is built to call these stubbed services. It fetches the history, then product details, and applies its recommendation algorithm.
5.  **UI Development:** The UI team builds the recommendation display components, fetching data from the (stubbed) recommendation engine.
6.  **Testing:** The recommendation logic and UI can be tested thoroughly using the predictable data from stubs.
7.  **Integration:** Later, when the real `UserActivityService` and `ProductCatalogService` are ready, the stubs are replaced. The system is then tested end-to-end.

This approach allows the recommendation logic and UI to be developed and tested long before the dependent services are finalized, accelerating the overall project timeline.
