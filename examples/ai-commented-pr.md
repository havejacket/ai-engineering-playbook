## AI-Assisted Pull Request Enhancement

This example demonstrates how AI can transform a standard Pull Request (PR) into a more understandable and review-efficient artifact.

### Before: Standard PR

**PR Title:** Fix Bug #123

**Description:**
```
Fixed the issue with user login.
```

**Code Snippet (example_module.py):**
```python
def process_user_data(user_id, data):
    # ...complex logic...
    if data.get('is_active'):
        # ...more logic...
        return True
    return False
```

**Reviewer Challenges:**
*   Vague description: What was the *actual* bug? How was it fixed?
*   Unclear impact: What other parts of the system might this change affect?
*   Time-consuming code review: Complex logic without inline explanations requires significant effort to understand.

### After: AI-Enhanced PR

**PR Title:** Fix Bug #123: Resolves intermittent login failures due to incorrect session handling

**AI-Generated Summary & Rationale:**
```
This PR addresses Bug #123, where users experienced intermittent login failures. The root cause was identified as improper handling of session tokens upon expiration, leading to authentication errors.

The fix involves:
1.  **Improved Session Validation:** Enhanced the `validate_session` function to correctly identify and refresh expired tokens before they cause a login attempt to fail.
2.  **Clearer Error Messaging:** Added specific error messages for different login failure scenarios (e.g., 'Session expired, please log in again,' 'Invalid credentials').
3.  **Refactoring `process_user_data`:** Simplified the control flow within `process_user_data` for better readability and maintainability (see inline comments).

**Potential Impact:**
*   This change primarily affects the authentication module.
*   No direct impact on other services is anticipated, but regression testing on user profile and order management modules (which rely on authentication) is recommended.

**Guidance for Reviewers:**
*   Please focus on the new token refresh logic in `auth_service.py`.
*   Verify the clarity and user-friendliness of the new error messages in `error_handler.py`.
*   Assess the refactoring of `process_user_data` in `example_module.py` for improved clarity.

**AI-Commented Code Snippet (example_module.py):**
```python
def process_user_data(user_id, data):
    # AI: This function processes user-specific data. It was identified as overly complex.
    # AI: Refactored to improve clarity and reduce nesting.

    # AI: Check if the 'is_active' flag is present and true in the input data.
    # AI: This flag indicates whether the user account is currently active.
    if data.get('is_active'):
        # AI: Further processing for active users.
        # AI: Previously, this block contained deeply nested conditional logic.
        # AI: Now simplified to a direct check and action.
        # ...simplified logic for active users...
        return True
    
    # AI: If user is not active or 'is_active' flag is missing/false, return False.
    return False
```

**Benefits of AI Enhancement:**
*   **Clarity:** AI provides a detailed explanation of the problem, solution, and rationale.
*   **Efficiency:** Reviewers can quickly grasp the changes and their implications.
*   **Targeted Review:** AI guides reviewers to focus on critical areas.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** Inline AI comments document complex logic, making the codebase easier to understand for future developers.
