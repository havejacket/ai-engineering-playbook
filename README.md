# AI Engineering Playbook

A practical guide to integrating AI into software development workflows.

## Overview
This playbook outlines techniques, prompts, GitHub Actions, and tool strategies for high-velocity teams adopting AI to improve developer productivity and delivery speed.

## Core Principles
- **Stub-Driven Development (SDD)**: Build mock-first, integrate last.
- **Prompt Discipline**: Think → Plan → Confirm → Execute.
- **Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic)**: Connect LLMs to external data sources like databases, APIs, and documents to enhance context and capabilities.
- **Architectural Memory**: Store key context in tools like Windsurf.
- **LLM-Aware Workflows**: Choose the right model for the job.
